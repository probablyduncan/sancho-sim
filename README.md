The squire's proverbs, densified, digitized, reorganized, and randomized. A Mad-Lib musical chairs of medieval proverbs, inspired by Edith Grossman's 2003 translation of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.

I built this in February 2025 and ported it here from my [main site](https://duncanpetrie.com)'s repo in August 2025.

The code here is bad!! It's all of it crammed into `index.astro` and please don't look at it! What a mess!

But that's ok, for if your eyes don’t see, your heart doesn’t break, and there are a lot of hours until tomorrow, when jests become realities, and anyway, how polished I’ll keep the spoons when I’m a shepherd.

And that's all I have to say about that.
